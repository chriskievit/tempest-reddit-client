# Tempest - another Reddit client

This project is part Reddit API wrapper, part Reddit client for MacOS. I've started this project because I couldn't get used to the Reddit redesign and because I wanted to learn some Swift. Because this is my first Swift project, my .NET background may seep through in my design decisions, but be sure to call me on that. Feel free to contribute (see [Contributing])
