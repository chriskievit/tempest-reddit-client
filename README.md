# Tempest - another Reddit client

This project is part Reddit API wrapper, part Reddit client for MacOS. I've started this project because I couldn't get used to the Reddit redesign and because I wanted to learn some Swift. Because this is my first Swift project, my .NET background may seep through in my design decisions, but be sure to call me on that.

## Built With

* [Swift 5.0.2](https://swift.org/getting-started/) - The framework used

## Installation

Be sure to add your own client ID and return url for your Reddit API app to the Config.xcconfig files in the application.
